Tableau Public link - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eric.yoon3643/viz/HappinessCovidProject/Dashboard1?publish=yes
This Dashboard Visualizes: 
- Covid cases per million
- Covid deaths per million
- Change in World Happiness Index

Tools used: SQL, Excel, Tableau
Data Source: 
- World Happiness Report (happiness index| https://worldhappiness.report/)

- Our World in Data (Covid data| https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) 

I also uploaded .sql files to show how I queried the data using SQL.
- HappinessIndexQuery.sql - shows how I queried the Happiness index data for each years
- CovidDeathsAndVaccination.sql - Query log of exploring the Covid dataset to understand the dataset before visualizing
